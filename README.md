«The place» is a tool to animals and humans to prevent and reduce the disruptions caused by and to human-built structures. Just  enter an address, choose building style, features and facilities, see the animal movement pattern and restrictions due to this and get some recommendations! 

ThePlace is PoC MVP application that uses heat maps, cluster analysis and computer vision to detect new animals and add them to the database. 

Who can use it? Actually, everybody: an ordinary person, big corporations & companies, government and also animal welfare organisations.
